# Stash Enterprise

[Stash](https://stash.run) by AppsCode is a cloud-native data backup and recovery solution for Kubernetes workloads. If you are running production workloads in Kubernetes, you might want to take backup of your disks, databases, etc. Traditional tools are too complex to set up and maintain in a dynamic compute environment like Kubernetes. Stash is a Kubernetes operator that uses [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) or Kubernetes CSI Driver VolumeSnapshotter functionality to address these issues. Using Stash, you can backup Kubernetes volumes mounted in workloads, stand-alone volumes, and databases. Users may even extend Stash via [addons](https://stash.run/docs/latest/guides/latest/addons/overview/) for any custom workload.
